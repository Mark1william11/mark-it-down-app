## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built with a modern, scalable, and professional tech stack.

### Core Technologies
*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **State Management:** Riverpod (with code generation)
*   **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication & Firestore Database)
*   **Local Database:** Drift (SQLite) for offline-first persistence.
*   **Routing:** GoRouter
*   **UI Packages:** `flutter_animate`, `fl_chart`, `google_fonts`, `flutter_hooks`

### Architecture
The app follows a clean, layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

*   **`Data` Layer:** Handles all data operations.
    *   **Models:** Plain Dart objects representing the app's data structures (`Todo`, `SubTask`).
    *   **Repository:** The single source of truth for data. It abstracts the data sources and implements the offline-first sync logic between the local database and Firestore.
    *   **Datasource:** The concrete implementation of the local database using Drift.
*   **`Logic` Layer:** Contains the core business logic, decoupled from the UI.
    *   **Services:** Classes like `AuthService`, `TodoService`, and `NotificationService` that orchestrate data operations and implement business rules.
*   **`Presentation` Layer:** The UI of the application.
    *   **Screens:** The main pages of the app (`HomeScreen`, `AuthScreen`, etc.).
    *   **Notifiers/Providers:** Riverpod providers that manage the state of the UI and connect it to the logic layer.
    *   **Widgets:** Reusable UI components that make up the screens.
*   **`Routing` Layer:** Defines all navigation paths and rules using GoRouter, including authentication-based redirects.
